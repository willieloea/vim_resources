  1. HOW TO USE THE GUIDE
Cut out section 4 and only use that after reading section 2 and 3.


  2. WHY VIM?
I know it doesn't seem like fun to use this, but if you use Vim correctly you
will almost never have to lift your hands form your keyboard while programming.
This will make you a faster programmer and is very satisfying.

  
  3. VIM THEORY
Vim has 4 modes:
 1. Normal mode (default)
 2. Insert mode (used for editing)
 3. Command mode (allows commands to be executed)
 4. Visual mode (also used for editing)

How to switch between the different modes:
       | Normal mode | [esc]
      /i     |:       \v
insert    command      visual

You can customize vim by editing your .vimrc file (in your home directory).
See this for a useful guide on customization:

  'gg' = goto document start
  'G' = goto document end
  'Shift' + 'h' = move cursor high on screen
  'Shift' + 'm' = move cursor middle on screen

  'r<char>' = replace cursor character with <char>
  'yy' = copy entire line
  'dd' = cut entire line
  'p' = paste
  'Ctrl' + 'Shift' + 'v' = paste from system clipboard
  'u' = undo
  'Ctrl' + 'r' = redo
  'i' = enter insert mode
  'I' = enter insert mode at the beginning of the line
  'a' = enter insert mode to the right of the cursor
  'A' = enter insert mode at the end of the line
  'o' = enter insert mode in new next line
  'Ctrl' + 'w' + 'v' = split vertically
  'Ctrl' + 'w' + 'l' = move to right window
  'Ctrl' + 'w' + 'h' = move to left window
  'Ctrl' + 'w' + 's' = split horizontally
  'Ctrl' + 'w' + 'j' = move to bottom window
  'Ctrl' + 'w' + 'k' = move to top window
  'Ctrl' + 'w' + '<' = increase window width
  'Ctrl' + 'w' + '>' = decrease window width
  'Ctrl' + 'w' + '+' = increase window height
  'Ctrl' + 'w' + '-' = decrease window height
  'Ctrl' + 'w' + '=' = reset window size

IN INSERT MODE:
  'Ctrl' + 'w' = delete word
  'Ctrl' + 'h' = delete character
  'Ctrl' + 'u' = delete everything left of cursor
  'Ctrl' + 'n'/'p' = autocomplete
  'Ctrl' + 'o' = allows normal mode command to follow, while in insert mode
  'Ctrl' + 'Shift' + 'v' = paste

IN COMMAND MODE
  'open <FILE_PATH>' = opens file at <FILE_PATH>
  'set number' = numbers lines
  '<number>' = navigates to line <number>

IN VISUAL MODE
